	    <p class="Box">The ability to go to the past or future in the blink of an eye opens dizzying new horizons of both morality and causality. Can one wield such a dangerous power and still call oneself a hero? Is it possible for one to 'cause' a thing if it was fated to happen? How can one change what one remembers occuring? Michael Hayes is a boy who must navigate these questions as he tries to become a superhero with his unconventional power.</p>

    	<p class="Box" id="authorsnote">Hello and welcome to One over Zero! My name is John Nicol and this has been my passion project since around 2018 or so. It started out as an attempt  to come up with a single-universe time travel system that was actually internally consistent, and came up with... ...well, I have yet to see exactly what it will become, but trust me, I have plans.<br><br> Most people are scared off by the "time travel" label, and understandably so, as it can be all kinds of mind-bending, and very few systems have even made sense in-universe &#40;Looking at you, Dr. Who!&#41;. I've tried to demystify the shenanigans Michael pulls off as much as possible, but if you still wind up confused, by all means contact me! <br><br>One more <em>very important</em> thing: The first three issues are on this site for free so you can determine whether this series is for you. From there, you can get a lifetime subscription for price that is determined by how far I've written/how much I've colored on the book. That means you pay once to get on a mailing list for each new book or new coloring of a book for as long as you want. At some point I might have an online payment system, but for the time being you'll have to contact me to subscribe.<br><br>
