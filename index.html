	    <p class="Box">The ability to go to the past or future in the blink of an eye opens dizzying new horizons of both morality and causality. Can one wield such a dangerous power and still call oneself a hero? Is it possible for one to 'cause' a thing if it was fated to happen? How can one change what one remembers occuring? Michael Hayes is a boy who must navigate these questions as he tries to become a superhero with his unconventional power.</p>

Hello and welcome to One over Zero! My name is John Nicol and this has been my passion project since around 2018 or so. It started out as an attempt to come up with a single-universe time travel system that was actually internally consistent, and came up with... ...well, I have yet to see exactly what it will become, but trust me, I have plans.  Most people are scared off by the "time travel" label, and understandably so, as it can be all kinds of mind-bending, and very few systems have even made sense in-universe (Looking at you, Dr. Who!). I've tried to demystify the shenanigans Michael pulls off as much as possible, but if you still wind up confused, by all means contact me!   One more very important thing: The first three issues are on this site so you can determine whether this series is for you. If you’re interested in reading more, E-mail me and we’ll talk more! 
    	E-mail me at <a href="mailto: john.patrick.nicol@gmail.com"> john.patrick.nicol@gmail.com </a>for more information.</p>
